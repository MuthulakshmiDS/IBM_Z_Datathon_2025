## üéØ Problem Statement

Despite the rising urgency of climate change and environmental degradation, environmental education remains largely theoretical in many Indian schools and colleges. Students are often taught textbook-based content with little emphasis on real-world application, local ecological issues, or personal responsibility.
There is a lack of engaging tools that motivate students to adopt eco-friendly practices or understand the direct consequences of their lifestyle choices. Traditional methods fail to instill sustainable habits or inspire youth participation in local environmental efforts.

## üß† Abstract

Environmental education is essential to raise awareness of sustainability, climate change, and green practices. Traditional methods of teaching are generally inefficient in teaching students. This leads to less participation and interest. Therefore, we suggest a gamified environmental education platform for schools and colleges.
The platform has interactive learning modules and gamification elements such as quizzes, badges, leaderboards, and eco-challenges that make learning about the environment enjoyable. The platform also provides simulations like carbon footprint calculators and recycling games to provide hands-on learning experiences. A teacher dashboard assists teachers in monitoring student progress, while an AI chatbot responds to environment-related queries in real time.
By integrating education, gamification, and technology, the platform stimulates interest and inspires students to adopt green ways. It provides schools with an efficient method of cultivating environmental consciousness.
